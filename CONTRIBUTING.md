1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Follow the coding style** (see below)
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Run security checks**: `npm audit`

#### Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code style
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small

#### Commit Messages

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add rate limiting to API endpoints

Implements configurable rate limiting per endpoint
to prevent abuse. Defaults to 100 requests/hour.

Closes #123
```

```

Previously would crash on expired session.
Now detects and prompts for re-authentication.

Fixes #456
```

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes
3. **Ensure CI passes** (when implemented)
4. **Request review** from maintainers
5. **Address feedback** promptly

### Development Setup

1. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/amazon-mcp-server.git
   cd amazon-mcp-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create `.env` from `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

4. Run in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Testing

Currently, testing is manual:

1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Start ngrok: `npm run tunnel`
3. Connect from Poke
4. Test each tool:
   - `search_amazon`
   - `add_to_cart`
   - `view_cart`
   - `check_login`

**Future**: Automated tests would be a great contribution!

## Security

Instead:
1. Email the maintainer privately via GitHub
2. Follow responsible disclosure practices
3. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details

### Security Considerations for Contributions

When contributing:
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Sanitize logs of sensitive data
- Follow secure coding practices
- Consider security implications of changes
- Document security-relevant changes
